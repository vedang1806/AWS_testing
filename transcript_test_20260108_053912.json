  "original_transcript": "Thank you for calling Riverbank Medical Center. This is Karan. How can I help you today? Hi Karen. My name is Sophia Lane. I previously signed a form of letting my ex-partner Jake Turner get information about my care. We are no longer together and I want that permission revoked immediately. I'm sorry to hear that Sofia. Let me open my chart. All right, I see your error. Yes, there is a disclosure from listing check. Turner is someone we can share information with. I want that removed. I don't want them to have access to anything anymore. I understand. The form you sign is valid until it expires or it's under there. It looks like you are set to expire about, yeah, usually, you want to late your quotes unless you have made a change. This is a major change. We broke up. It was ugly, and I don't want him hearing anything about my health. I'm sorry that happened. Technically we add a note that you are uncomfortable with him the information, but it's originally authorization is still part of your file, so staff may still rely on it if he calls. That's exactly what I don't want. I'm telling you, he should not get any information. The challenge it already has a side and our team is trying to follow those forms. If I just delete him from the list, it might look alter a bigger. And add something that clearly says it's no longer valid. What I can do I recommend not what if you because we want to share update your honestly absolutely but. Just say if he calls some staff a judgment. No, not unless necessary. I wanted to say do not share, full stop. If you like to do not send someone might hesitate during a situation where he could actually have if you are unreachable and he calls asking if you are OK so we need some flexibility. I don't want that. I don't trust them. I understand. But our policies to existing sign forms changing the midstream can create a confusion for staffing. Most passengers like. This isn't a major inconvenience. It's about my safety and privacy. I hear you. I will add a note. Patient expressed concern about ex-partner there. Staff should be a person when sending information, but existing authorize immersion on file. HVU concern is a document. That's not enough. If he calls tomorrow, will you give him my test results? If he definitely himself in the site authorization some staff said when he updates especially he be part of support system may not be recouraged them to most guarded. Don't want them to be guarded. I want them to say we can't talk to you. For that kind of cheap log if you are probably need to submit a new formal regulation on our privacy office or the phone I'm limited to adding internal comments. Can you at least suspend it until that form is processed? Our system doesn't have a suspend button or for authorization. They are either there or not. If I remove it, it from never can. It will put a just streaky for letter. I'll send the form today, but from this moment on, I do not consent to you sharing anything with her. I will write you get prior authorization have been advised submitted the paperwork. Until that is received and processed. The current authorization technically. Still applies. So you're saying if he calls tomorrow morning before you get the form you might still tell him things? Yes, that may still deliver on signed document until the paperwork gets. That's why the cleanest way to handle from a complaints standpoint. That feels completely backward. My wishes should not matter more than a piece of paper from months ago. Which is to make better. That's why I'm looking your concern, but For our records perspective, we need to get updated documents. Once it's final, we can officially mark his access as a result. Can you read me exactly what you're writing? Sure, I'm entering patient's call requesting change to a prior authorization plan ex partner they turn to receive information. Patient now uncomfortable. Staff should use uh discretion when responding his inque and patients and advice to complete revocation from original authorization remains until processed. That still sounds like you're leaving the door open. Sleeve room for clinical judgment. Yes, that's intentional. Once you relocation from using we can tighten it. What if he shows up in person and says he's still on the phone? If you show ID and reference also and staff would be like confirm basic information, especially a situation where he comes and checking your safety might not might to share less details, but it would not block him entirely. This is exactly what I'm afraid of. And the fastest thing is send to the relocation from today. I can email you. The link and the instructions so you can fill out online. Fine, send it, but I want it clear in my record that I told you I no longer consent from today on. I'll save my notebook as we discussed. When your form is processed, the authorization to check will expire reward. Until then, we will use to an easy contacts. All right, I'm not happy with this, but I'll submit the form right away. Understood. You can email and your medical de can subject authorization update. If you have any trouble. With the form, you can call back and we will walk you through it. OK, thank you. You're welcome Sophia. Take care. Bye. Goodbye. Yeah, thank you for calling Riby Medical Center. This is Karin. How can I help you today? Hi Karen, my name is Sophia Lane. I previously signed a form letting my ex-partner Jake Turner get information about my care. We are no longer together. I'm sorry. Let me open your chart. All right, I see your record. There is a disclosure and let's check some when can you have the information. Yeah, I want it removed. I don't want him to have access to anything anymore. I understand the form sign is in very expired update. It looks like uh it's set to expire and about usually the major changes. Uh, this is a major change. We broke up. We, we broke up. It was ugly and I don't want him hearing about anything about my health. I'm sorry that that happened technically. We can add a note you are comfortable with having it, but originally authorized is still part of your file, so staff may still rely on CM calls. That's exactly what I don't want. I'm telling you, he should not get any information. The challenge he already signed authorization and our team is still on follow those forms. If I just delete him from this list, I would like a center and legal documents. Uh, then add something that clearly says it's no longer valid. What I again so we com of CRF for we don't set up updates with him unless necessary we get by the policy staff and just judgment. No, not unless necessary. I wanted to say do not share, full stop. If we will write, do not said someone might be inside during the he situation actually because I see you are other and me. I don't want that flexibility. I don't trust them. I understand, but our policies is not to existing sign from changing them and stream game we had a computer for staff and the next time. This isn't a minor convenience.
